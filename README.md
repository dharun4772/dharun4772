I'm passionate about __Machine Learning__, __Data Science__, , __Reinforcement Learning__, , __Causal Inference__, __Large Language Models (LLMs)__ and __Generative AI__. 

The rapid rate at which there is advancement in computing power and the freedom to take a large volume of data pushes the field of Artificial Intelligence to a whole new level.

<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>

I hold a Masters Degree in Data Science at [__Northeastern University - Khoury College of Computer Sciences__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/).

I have *4+ years* of experience in creating inferences with data, building __machine learning__ and __deep learning models__. I measure the impact of a project with the business goals of a company and its impact on customers. Furthermore, I have a strong practical and theoretical experience in the development and deployment of __Large Language Models (LLMs)__, __Generative AI__, Reinforement learning, and Causal Inference.

üî≠ Below are some of the companies I have worked as a data scientist and a machine learning engineer:

* *Bevi - a beverage company*
* *Swiggy - a food delivery platform*
* *Tata Consultancy Services*
* *Khoury College of Computer Sciences*

üî≠ I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

* *Linear Regression*
* *Logistic Regression*
* *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
* *Decision Trees (DT)*

* *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
* *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)*
* *Naive Bayes (NB)*
* *Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)*
* *XGBoost*
* *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)*

üî≠ Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects: 

* *Auto-Regressive (AR) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Moving Averages (ARMA) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) Model*
* *Neural Hierarchical Interpolation of Time Series (N-HiTS) Model*
* *Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) Model*

üî≠ Furthermore, below are some of the tools used during my experience for __Generative AI__:

* *Langchain*
* *LangGraph*
* *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*
* *OpenAI API*
* *Mixtral (LLM)*
* *Llama 2 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 3 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 3.5 (LLM)*
* *GPT - 4 (LLM)*

üî≠ Here are some of the skillsets in regards to __DevOps__ technologies:

* *Docker*
* *Docker-Compose*
* *Linux*
* *Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)*
* *Ubuntu*
* *GitLab CI/CD*

üè´ [__Northeastern University (Khoury College of Computer Science)__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu) - *Masters in Data Science*

I have pursued a [Master's in Data Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/data-science-ms/) at Khoury College of Computer sciences. During the course, I've learned to implement various machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the courses that were taught really shaped the way in which I approached machine learning and data science problems. I had an opportunity to learn machine learning algorithms from a theoretical point of view by doing assignments and projects pertaining to the course. It also helped me learn some important courses that were really influential in my progress toward learning the concepts of data science. Courses such as Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning, and Data Visualization helped me understand the practical ways in which data science is used in industrial applications.

üè´ [__Amrita School of Engieering__](https://www.amrita.edu/) - *B.Tech in Civil Engineering*

I've completed a Bachelor of Technology in the field of [Civil Engineering(CIE)](https://www.amrita.edu/program/btech-civil-engineering/) and got a good understanding of the concepts such as Fluid Mechanics and Statistical Experimentation and how they influence the overall problem statement in real-life. During my 4 year journey, I came to the conclusion that we would be learning various tools and techniques to build anything from ground up. Furthermore, this gave me a good understanding of mathematical design and other important topics that could also be used in machine learning analysis respectively.

## üìΩüìΩ My Kaggle Profile 

I'm very familiar with __Kaggle__ - a website that would help __data scientists__ and __machine learning engineers__ to explore the data and perform machine learning predictions. I would be taking my time to read the kaggle projects which give me a good idea about the working of machine learning models. Furthermore, I would read others' code as a result of which I get a good understanding of the various ways in which a machine learning project could be implemented. Below is a list of all the work that I did in __Kaggle__. Feel free to take a look and give your feedback! Thanks.

## üé¨üîö Summary

These are some of my __projects__, __blogs__ and __certifications__ that I have worked on and uploaded on __GitHub__. I would be looking forward to learning new technologies in the field of __AI__ and __machine learning__ by going through a few more courses and applying my knowledge to different projects. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need any explanations of the projects. Looking forward to sharing my knowledge with the community.

Below are some of the ways we might connect. Feel free to share your thoughts. Thanks!üòÅ
