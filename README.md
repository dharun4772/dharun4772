🏫 [__Northeastern University (Khoury College of Computer Science)__](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu) - *Masters in Data Science*

I have pursued a [Master's in Data Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/data-science-ms/) at Khoury College of Computer sciences. During the course, I've learned to implement various machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the courses that were taught really shaped the way in which I approached machine learning and data science problems. I had an opportunity to learn machine learning algorithms from a theoretical point of view by doing assignments and projects pertaining to the course. It also helped me learn some important courses that were really influential in my progress toward learning the concepts of data science. Courses such as Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning, and Data Visualization helped me understand the practical ways in which data science is used in industrial applications.

🏫 [__Amrita School of Engieering__](https://www.amrita.edu/) - *B.Tech in Civil Engineering*

I've completed a Bachelor of Technology in the field of [Civil Engineering(CIE)](https://www.amrita.edu/program/btech-civil-engineering/) and got a good understanding of the concepts such as Fluid Mechanics and Statistical Experimentation and how they influence the overall problem statement in real-life. During my 4 year journey, I came to the conclusion that we would be learning various tools and techniques to build anything from ground up. Furthermore, this gave me a good understanding of mathematical design and other important topics that could also be used in machine learning analysis respectively.

## 📽📽 My Kaggle Profile 

I'm very familiar with __Kaggle__ - a website that would help __data scientists__ and __machine learning engineers__ to explore the data and perform machine learning predictions. I would be taking my time to read the kaggle projects which give me a good idea about the working of machine learning models. Furthermore, I would read others' code as a result of which I get a good understanding of the various ways in which a machine learning project could be implemented. Below is a list of all the work that I did in __Kaggle__. Feel free to take a look and give your feedback! Thanks.
